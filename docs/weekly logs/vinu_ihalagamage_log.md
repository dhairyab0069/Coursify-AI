### Tasks in progress
- Finding appropriate settings that suits our web application.
- Learning to display each setting page within the main settings page.
- For example: I have profile settings, notifications, and preferences as the 3 options in the main settings page. I'm learning how to display each of these 3 pages within the main settings page through the js script.
- Implementing APIs

### Tasks completed
- Creating the settings page and matching the overall format of the web application. The settings page includes all 3 options mentioned above, and forms inside of each of the page. Next steps are to use js to have these pages open up on the main settings page instead of a new URL.

### Tasks in progress
- I have created forms for each setting, for example, the Account Settings would have a form that is populated with the user's name, username, email and password, and then the notification settings would have a form that controls the notifications. I am having a fair bit of trouble figuring out how to display these forms on the main settings page once the option clicked.
- Displaying these forms in the main settings page (when the sepcific setting option is clicked) is executed via the js script. My next step is writing the unctional javascript code inside of the HTML file using the <script> tags to see if I can result in a more efficient outcome.

### Tasks Completed
- The overall look of the setting page with the 3 settings options displayed.
