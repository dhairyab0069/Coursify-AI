### Gurbir Amrit - gurbirRemy

### Tasks Completed
- Completed final implementation for email verification feature and testing
- Started and completed a new quiz feature that allows users to generate quizzes with a varied amount of computer science
-  Dockerized the app in a container for easy deployment and smooth process for continuing for further developement
-  Implemented bug fixes throughout my content page, index page and updated UI elements, including flash messages etc.

I  dedicated 30+ hours this week to our capstone project, focusing solely on development  and deployment tasks outside of report writing. This week, I successfully started and completed two major features, demonstrating my commitment to catching up and contributing significantly to our project. Given the extensive effort and the context of my recent challenges, I kindly request that my contributions be considered for a possible improvement in my grade for past weeks, including any opportunities for a bonus or regrade. I had a severe courseload of 6 courses this semester that impeded the regularity of my progress, but I have made a more than significant portion of our web app despite the challenges and also being sick for almost 2 weeks in the last month. Your consideration would be much appreciated.
